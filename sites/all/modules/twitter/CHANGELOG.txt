Twitter 2.6, 2009-07-02
----------------------
A cleaner fix for the data type issue with twitter ids. We now store status IDs
and twitter user ids as NUMERIC fields instead of STRINGS. This isn't awesome,
but it works for now. We'll probably change this again in the future we feel
cheeky.

Added support for the Twitter in-reply-to fields for incoming statuses. It's now
possible to build views of 'original' tweets or 'reply' tweets by filtering on
the reply fields, as well. Note that only FRESHLY imported statuses will have
the reply data.

Added a new view-based block that shows ALL tweets on the site, not just tweets
for the current user.

Eliminated the unholy abomination that was custom_twitter_shorten_url(). If you
want outgoing tweets to use another URL shortening service, install the Shorten
module, and it will be used automatically.

- #475808 - Added twitter.api.php to the project to document hooks.
- #480222 - minor fix to the function signature for hook_nodeapi.
- #477756 - minor cleanup of the comments in the install file.
- #504112 - add an API function to support sending direct messages.
- #392834 - make it possible to hide the 'Drupal' attribution line when statuses
  are posted.
- #301317 - last_refresh didn't have a default value. Adding accounts died in
  mysql strict mode.
